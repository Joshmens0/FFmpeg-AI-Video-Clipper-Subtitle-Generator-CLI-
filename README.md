ðŸŽ¬ FFmpeg AI Video Clipper & Subtitle Generator (CLI)

The FFmpeg AI Video Clipper & Subtitle Generator is a powerful command-line application designed to streamline the entire video editing workflow â€” from trimming clips to generating transcriptions and burning subtitles automatically. It combines the speed and precision of FFmpeg with the intelligence of AI transcription models to create a seamless, all-in-one video processing experience for creators, editors, and developers.

This tool allows you to clip videos precisely by specifying start and end timestamps, eliminating the need for bulky editing software. Once a segment is defined, the program uses OpenAIâ€™s Whisper transcription engine (or any configured AI model) to transcribe spoken dialogue from the video into accurate, readable text. With a single command, you can automatically generate and embed subtitles into your video, ensuring accessibility and professional polish for your content.

Whether youâ€™re producing educational tutorials, social media clips, interviews, or podcasts, this tool simplifies your workflow. The command-line interface (CLI) is intuitive, making it easy to process multiple files or automate tasks using scripts. The result is a highly efficient workflow that drastically reduces manual effort while maintaining broadcast-quality results.
